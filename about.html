  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Fatema Malam. I am a UX Designer based in London, UK. I come primarily from an extensive psychology background, with bachelor degree in Psychology and Masters in psychology research from Kings College London. I have always been fascinated of how brain works and how we perceive and retain information.
On that note, combining my passion for technology with psychology, I decided to further develop my skills in Human computer interaction, as a UX designer. This passion grew from working as a social media executive for Vevian shoes, where I constantly engaged with users and helped improve brand perception through their website and Instagram. In having said that, I love to find and solve problems in order to provide a more meaningful and fun experience for users.  
My professional journey continued as I nurtured my creative side through web/mobile-design and photography, which extended my ability to develop and design a more effective solutions, allowing me to focus my energy on the task at hand. When I’m in my element, I’m creating, but I understand that creativity without context lacks purpose.
As a user experience (UX) designer and a Psychologist, I have a deep interest in how people connect through verbal and visual communication, with great capacity for emotional and cognitive empathy. I attempt to integrate my knowledge of psychology into everything I design. I feel my multifaceted background and skillset has given me a deeper understanding of — and unique perspective into — the UX/UI design process. 
When I’m not thinking about (or actually doing) design, I love travelling, taking pictures on my new camera, spending time with friends, belly-dancing or trying out new restaurants and cafes.</p>
