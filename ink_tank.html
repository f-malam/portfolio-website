    <p> Ink Tank is a responsive web app that provides information and inspiration from wide range of Tattoos designs and artists, specializing in different styles. As you can imagine, choosing a permanent tattoo design is an incredible personal
      experience but it can be quite stressful and complicated. Therefore, Ink Tank app offers a step by step guide and services for Tattoo enthusiast and Tattoo seekers to help with their Tattoo Planning. This is the story of how I 
      designed the app that aims to deliver a pleasant experience during the Tattoo planning and make people feel confident with their Tattoo decision at the end, with no regrets.

      <h4>UX Design</h4>
      <p>
        As part of my UX design course at Career Foundry, I was given a project brief to build a Tattoo Application from scratch. During this intensive course, all elements in the UX design process are extensively discussed and implemented.
        Following the project brief, I was responsible for the strategy and design of the responsive web application. I led the the UX project involving competitive Research, User strategy, Testing & interface design, following Design Thinking
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge was to create a product from scratch using softwares which I was not familiar with. To overcome this challenge, I learnt and practice the softwares and focused on 3 features of the project. There was also a time restraint on
        the project. This was a 6 month intensive course project but I managed to finish the project 1 month early using my Time mamangement skills.

      <h4>The approach to Understanding</h4>
      <p>
        First, I conducted an extensive research on the Tattoo market and existing Tattoo apps in order to  understand the industry and potential users.  I found two leading companies in the tattoo app industry that offers similar services. One is
        Tattoodo and another one is InkHunter. Both apps are really good and fun, however, after completing a full competitive analysis including; competitors profile, market profile, business strategy, SWOT analysis & UX/UI analysis , I found their
        services limited and lacked a lot of information and guidance.  In having said that, I was able to find and determine the problem that users are currently experiencing.

      <div class="topandbottom">
        <h3 class="sub">Problem & Objective</h3>
        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>
          The existing Tattoo apps do not seem to address the complexity and emotional element of finding and choosing the right Tattoo design and the right Tattoo Artist. Many of these apps tend to lack reliable information and guidance, which
          results into many people regretting their decision at the end.
          In order to make users enjoy their Tattoo experience and prevent any regrets, I planned to design and develop a platform that offers a personalized service to help with the whole Tattoo planning.​​​​​​​

      <!--Interview-->

        <h3 class="sub">Interview</h3>
        <h4>Focusing on Goals</h4>
        <p>
          Following an extensive research with competitors, it was important for me to understand and identify with potential users. Therefore, I engaged with my target audience by interviewing and observing them on behavior and attitude. The main
          research goals were; 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Understand how Tattoo seekers find, choose and decide on a Tattoo designs and Tattoo Artists.</li>
          <li>Understand any concerns and issues that may arise in the process of looking or getting a Tattoo.</li>
          <li>Determine what features and functions meet users needs and demands.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By focusing on potential users who either have a Tattoo, who is looking to get a new Tattoo, and who is interesting in getting a Tattoo for the first time, it helped me gain more in-depth insights.

      <h3 class="sub">Affinity Maps</h3>
      <h4>Sorting & Mapping</h4>
      <p>
        I created an affinity map using the insights collected during the Interview. From the insights, I identified behaviors, goals, and attitudes of the participants towards a similar Tattoo apps and services that they have encountered during
        their Tattoo process. This helped me understand users problems and needs more clearly. ​​​​​​​
      </p>
      <p>
        One statement found from all users at one point in the interview was, and quote, 
      </p>
      <p class="gold center">
        <i>'I don't want to have any regrets'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I found this statement very moving and effective because it made me understand that this is one of the biggest challenges users face everyday when going through a Tattoo process. This made me put myself in their position and helped me
        generate ideas to find solution to their problems and needs.

        me focus on the user’s problems and priorities on relevant functions and features in my design to meet their needs, which in turn help speed up the process.

        Bringing the ideas to life, I got creative and sketched low-fidelity wireframes. Sketching was so much fun. I saw it as an easy, quick and a playful way to create ideas. At this point in the process, I was less worried about any of the
        design-specific details. Instead, I was be able to focus on the idea itself. In doing so, I had a change of mind along the way, I kept iterating which led me to make new decisions and new sketches. Sketching helped me catch potential
        problems and promising insights faster and earlier in the process.

        Wireframes and prototypes were tested constantly and iterated progressively to determine the user flows and put these to test with potential users from my target audience. I created working prototypes for mobile and desktop versions in

        Usability test was conducted on both in-person and remote with potential users, to define the task, establish objectives & evaluate the app. In order to ensure the reliability of the test, usability test focused on 3 core features of the Ink
        Tank app and they are as follows;

        Test revealed participants found it easy to navigate through the Ink tank app. However, usability issues were identified that was related to information, layout and visibility. Iterations were made to solve these issues. I was able to find
        appropriate solutions to  improve  the app for better user experience, whilst focusing on users needs at all times. This was re-tested for validation.

          One of the issues particpants found was the lack of information about the Artists. This was solved by adding a 'About' section with detail informaiton of Artist's current status, history, their story and inspiration etc, on the Artist
          detail page.

      </div>
      <p>
        Another issue participants encountered was the lack of knowledge about the app before login. Few users were unaware that they could access more information about the app before getting into the app. This was resolved by adding 'Swipe for
        more' text on the welcome page.
      </p>
      <p>
        For further testing, I decided to conduct a preference (A/B) test on the welcome page. The reason I chose to test the welcome page is because it is the first impression users have about the app. Therefore it was important to test out what
        users prefer and what meets their needs before even getting into the app.

        <p>
          The results indicated 60% of users preferred option 1: with a ‘swipe for more’ text. The reasons behind their choice are based on the fact that it was a clearer guidance to swipe for more information about the app. 40% preferred the option
          2: without ‘swipe for more’ text. They found the dots to be self-intuitive. Overall, option 1 welcome page would be most effective for better user experience of Ink Tank App. Based on the results, I updated the welcome page.
          <br>
          <br>It was very useful to get feedback from potential users based on their reaction to the app prototype. The results allowed me to make necessary changes and continue to make improvements.

        the app. With solid typography, color, and imagery, I ended up creating a style guide to ensure consistency throughout the app.

        The Ink Tank App has received both positive and negative feedback since our first update. Potential users have responded well to the app's features and the simplistic redesign. Unfortunately, there are still more testing to be conducted,
        subject to ongoing improvements. I need to focus on the UI elements furthermore and make changes. On that note, I would need to conduct another usability test and preference test of the UI to test out the new updated version of the Ink Tank
