          Flash is a Vocabulary Learning Application that provides a fun way to learn and expand new words, as well as help retain words on-the-go. The core features include; creating digital flashcards, review function where users can study the words
          they want to learn and/or improve on. Last but not least, a function where users can track their progress step by step and check overall performance over time.

      <div class="container page bottom-space">
        <h3 class="sub">My Role</h3>
        <h4>UX Design</h4>
        <p>
          As part of my UX Fundamental course at Career Foundry, I was given a project brief to research and re-design the experience of memorizing and understanding new concepts, techniques, and terms, by exploring how people learn vocabulary and
          designing a mobile application to address their goals and problems. Following the project brief, I was responsible for the strategy and design of a mobile vocabulary Application. I led the UX project involving Competitor & User Research,
          User strategy, User testing, following Design Thinking process to build an Application that empowers people to learn new vocabulary. During this course, the early stages of the UX design process are discussed and implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenge was to sketch a low-fidelity prototype of the product from scratch without focusing on details and visuals too much. To overcome this challenge, I learnt to focus on the functions and the content during the early stages,
          without losing myself in details at the beginning. This saved a lot of my time and helped me keep on track with user's problems.

          <h3 class="sub">Competitive Research</h3>
          <h4>The Approach to Understanding</h4>
          <p>
            First, I conducted an informal competitive analysis on existing mobile Applications for learning vocabulary, in order to understand and get a better idea of the industry and what's already out there. This gave me a chance to better
            understand potential users and their needs.  I found three leading companies in the vocabulary app industry that offers similar services and they are; Magoosh, Quizlet and vocabulary.com.  
            After completing a competitive analysis, I found their strength and weakness. I was able to find and determine the problem that users are currently experiencing.

          <!--Interview-->
          <div class="topandbottom">
            <h3 class="sub">Interview</h3>
            <h4>Observing & Focusing on Goals</h4>
            <p>
              Following an extensive research with competitors, I engaged with my target audience by interviewing and observing 5 people on behavior and experience towards learning and vocabulary use. The purpose of the interview was to better
              understand how people approach to learning and memorizing new vocabularies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Combining my notes from the Interview, I summarized them into what participants were 'doing', 'thinking' and 'feeling'. Using Qualitative method, I ended up getting more insights to users’ needs and problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was hard to find potential participants from my target audience for interviews and test. I wanted to ensure
              I interview people who've engaged in some sort of educational or vocabulary-learning activity, to get a better insight.
              I did eventually find participants from my target audience at the end, but then there were problems in scheduling time with them. For this reason, I learnt that it's important to be flexible and plan accordingly to your participants
              schedule.
            </p>

        <h2>User Persona</h2>
        <div class="container page bottom-space">
          <h3 class="sub">Point Of View</h3>
          <h4>Building my Audience</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the research found in the discovery period of the project, a persona was developed, Omar. Designing for Omar helped in making informed design decisions as I had the end user always in mind and helped me put myself in his position.
          </p>
          <div class="center movemoredown">

          <div class="topandbottom">
            <h3 class="sub">Problem & Objective</h3>
            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>
              I was able to understand and identify Omar's problems. One problem he has is that he needs a way to learn certain words that he finds difficult for his exam in a small-time frame. In having said that, I believe by designing a vocabulary
              learning app with a ‘Review and Revise’ feature that allows Omar to select and study certain words he finds difficult and wants to focus and/or improve on, will help him not only pass his exams but also help him learn and retain words more
              quickly in a short period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, being a busy student, Omar gets lost and lose track of his progress very easily. For that reason, he needs a way to see how well he is doing and if he ready for his exam. I believe adding a ‘my progress’ function will allow him to
              track his progress step by step and check his overall performance over time.
            </p>
            <div class="center movemoredown">

            </div>
            <div class="movemoredown">
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenge Omar faces every day is time. He has a very small amount of time that he wants to use to maximize his knowledge. He also finds it quite difficult to learn without getting distracted. I think we have all been
                there at some point in our lives. Don’t you agree?
              </p>
              <p>
                One statement found from Omar was and quote,
              </p>
              <p class="center gold">
                <i>‘He likes to have control over what he wants to learn’</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                I found this statement very powerful, which truly helped me understand that it’s all about what the user wants and how they can control what they learn from the app. This made me put myself in his position, and collect ideas to find
                solution to Omar's problems and needs.

            Keeping Omar in mind, I created a task analysis and user flow for the key tasks within the app. This helped me think through the core features and functions and ensure a seamless process that would be relevant and required for my users.

          <h4>Building Frameworks & Exploring Interaction</h4>
          <p>
            Bringing the ideas to life, following a quick sketch, I tried to put everything together to see which idea would work best and to make it user friendly and easy to navigate through the app. In doing so, I had a change of mind along the way,
            which led me to make new decisions and new sketches of what features are removed and added and where features are positioned on the app.
            After reviewing these ideas, I finalized my sketches with more detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found Sketching to be so much fun. It is an easy, quick and playful way to create and explore more ideas. Using pencil and paper, I was less worried about any of the design-specific details. Instead, I was able to focus on the idea itself.
            Also, by building a practical, preliminary version of the app, I was able to catch potential problems and promising insights faster and earlier in the process.

          <h3 class="sub">Usability Test</h3>
          <h4>Working with Humans</h4>
          <p>
            The prototypes were ready to be tested. I decided to focus and test on 6 important aspects on functionality;
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Onboarding phase where the user creates an account to get started.</li>
            <li>Creating a new flashcard set as a way to add their own new vocabulary words and definitions.</li>
            <li>Review words that users find quite difficult.</li>
            <li>Track progress to check performance over time. </li>
            <li>Set target to learn certain amount of words by certain date.</li>
            <li>Access profile page where user can change their profile picture.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I chose these functions to test because they relate to the feature requirement in the project brief and relate directly to Omar in reference to my target audience needs. I wanted to go through a process that one would undergo in the real
            world when being hired to create a similar project like this. With having said that, in the real word, I would constantly relate back to the project brief to ensure I am implementing the functionality that any given client is looking for as
            well as referring back to my user’s needs at all times.

            <div>
              <p>
                After conducting the first round of usability test on five participants, there were few improvements that were needed for better user experience.

                <div class="column">
                  <p>
                    Firstly, participants were unaware that they could find information about the benefits of the app before signing up. For that reason, I added ‘swipe to learn more’ below the welcome logo.
                  </p>
                </div>

                    Secondly, majority of the participants found it quite difficult to find target in order to complete their task of setting a target. For that reason, I moved Target from settings to the dashboard, where it's clear and easy to find.
                  </p>

                    Last but not least, participants found it Simple and easy to find review and progress. But they didn’t know what word from which sets they are reviewing and they wanted to have an option to track progress for each set, not just the
                    overall performance.
                    In that case, I restructured the ‘My progress’ function by adding a new screen, where users can select the set they wish to review and check performance. This provides a better structure for Omar,
                    to systematically categorize and study vocabulary, in preparation for his exam.

          <h4>Making Further Improvements</h4>
          <div>
            <p> After making first round of improvements, I conducted a second round of usability test with different participants. There are few more improvements needed to make user experience much better and they are as follow;
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Add a tutorial to get them started. This would guide the user through the app and show them where everything is.</li>
              <li>Allow users to add additional words and definitions in their native Language by adding a ‘Add more words’ function on the front side of the card and ‘Add more definition’ function on the back side of the card.</li>
              <li>Have an option where users can review words from all sets in one go. I plan to add a ‘All Sets’ function as an option for users to select when they are deciding what they want to review.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Running a usability test was extremely helpful to improve my app and focus on the user’s needs. It was a great way to continue to get feedback from potential users based on their reaction to the app prototype, and continue to make
              improvements.

            In having said that, trying to make your app perfect on your first attempt is never possible. There are always going to be glitches and errors. It’s better to get as many criticisms as you possible can in order to ensure your app functions
